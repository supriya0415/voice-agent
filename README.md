# 30 Days of Voice Agent Challenge

Welcome to the repository for my 30 Days of Voice Agents Challenge\! This project documents the journey of building a sophisticated, voice-activated conversational AI from the ground up. Over the course of this challenge, a simple web page evolves into a fully interactive voice agent capable of holding context-aware conversations, now deployed and accessible online.

## 🤖 About The Project

This project is a hands-on guide to building a voice-based conversational AI using modern web technologies and powerful AI APIs. You can engage in a continuous, voice-to-voice conversation with an AI powered by Google's Gemini LLM. The agent remembers the context of your conversation, allowing for natural follow-up questions and a more human-like interaction.

The repository is structured by day, with each folder representing a significant step in the development process, from setting up the server to implementing a full conversational loop with memory and deploying it to the cloud.

### Key Features

  * **Voice-to-Voice Interaction**: Speak to the agent and receive a spoken response, creating a seamless conversational experience.
  * **Contextual Conversations**: The agent maintains a chat history for each session, enabling it to understand the flow of dialogue and respond to follow-up questions intelligently.
  * **End-to-End AI Pipeline**: It seamlessly integrates multiple AI services for a complete Speech-to-Text → Large Language Model → Text-to-Speech pipeline.
  * **Modern & Intuitive UI**: A clean, user-friendly interface with a single-button control and visual feedback for different states (e.g., ready, recording, thinking).
  * **Robust Error Handling**: Includes a fallback audio response for graceful failure when an API call is unsuccessful, ensuring a smooth user experience.
  * **Live Deployment**: The voice agent is deployed to the cloud and is publicly accessible.

      * **FastAPI**: For building the high-performance, asynchronous API server.
      * **Uvicorn**: As the ASGI server to run the FastAPI application.
      * **Python-Dotenv**: To manage environment variables securely.
      * **WebSockets**: For real-time, bidirectional communication between the client and server.
  * **Frontend**:
      * **HTML, CSS, JavaScript**: For the structure, styling, and client-side logic.
      * **Bootstrap**: For creating a responsive and modern user interface.
      * **MediaRecorder API & WebSocket API**: To capture and stream audio directly from the user's microphone in the browser.
  * **AI & Voice APIs**:
      * **Murf AI**: For generating high-quality, natural-sounding Text-to-Speech (TTS), including streaming capabilities.
      * **AssemblyAI**: For providing fast and accurate real-time Speech-to-Text (STT) transcription with turn detection.
      * **Google Gemini**: As the Large Language Model (LLM) for generating intelligent and coherent responses, with streaming and function calling.
      * **SerpAPI**: For real-time Google Search results, giving the agent access to current information.
  * **Deployment**:
      * **Render.com**: For hosting the application and making it publicly available.

## ⚙️ Architecture

The application follows a client-server architecture. The frontend, running in the user's browser, is responsible for capturing audio and managing the user interface. The FastAPI backend acts as the orchestrator, managing the complex interactions between the various AI services.

Here is the flow for a single turn in a conversation:

1.  The **Client** captures the user's voice using the MediaRecorder API and sends the audio data to the backend.
2.  The **FastAPI Server** receives the audio file.
3.  It first sends the audio to **AssemblyAI** to be transcribed into text (STT).
4.  The server retrieves the chat history for the current session and appends the new transcript. This entire context is then sent to the **Google Gemini LLM**.
5.  Gemini processes the conversation and generates a text response, which is sent back to the server.
6.  The server adds the LLM's response to the chat history and forwards the text to **Murf AI** for speech synthesis (TTS).
7.  The server receives the final audio URL from Murf AI and sends it back to the client.
8.  The **Client** automatically plays the received audio, and the UI updates to indicate it's ready for the user's next turn.

  * API keys for:
      * Murf AI
      * AssemblyAI
      * Google Gemini
      * SerpAPI

#### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository**
    ```sh
    git clone 
    ```
2.  **Navigate to the latest project directory** (e.g., `day-30`).
    ```sh
    cd 30-days-of-voice-agents/day-30/
    ```
3.  **Install the required dependencies** from the `requirements.txt` file.
    ```sh
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
4.  **Create a `.env` file** in the chosen day's directory. Copy the contents of `.env.example` (if available) or create it from scratch.
    ```
    MURF_API_KEY="your_murf_api_key_here"
    ASSEMBLYAI_API_KEY="your_assemblyai_api_key_here"
    GEMINI_API_KEY="your_gemini_api_key_here"

## 🗓️ Project Journey: Day 1 to 30

Here is a summary of the progress made during the challenge.

  * **Day 01**: Laid the foundation with a basic **FastAPI server** and a simple **Bootstrap UI**.
  * **Day 02**: Integrated the **Murf AI API** to create the first endpoint for Text-to-Speech (TTS).
  * **Day 03**: Built the **frontend interface** to interact with the TTS endpoint, allowing users to type text and hear it spoken.
  * **Day 04**: Developed a client-side **Echo Bot** using the `MediaRecorder` API to record and play back user audio.
  * **Day 05**: Enhanced the echo bot by implementing **server-side audio upload**, moving from client-only to a client-server model.
  * **Day 06**: Integrated the **AssemblyAI API** for Speech-to-Text (STT), allowing the server to transcribe user audio.
  * **Day 07**: Created a **voice transformation bot** by chaining the STT and TTS services. The app would listen, transcribe, and speak the user's words back in a different voice.
  * **Day 08**: Introduced intelligence by integrating the **Google Gemini LLM**, creating an endpoint that could generate text-based responses to queries.
  * **Day 09**: Achieved a full **voice-to-voice conversational loop**. The app could now listen to a spoken question and provide a spoken answer generated by the LLM.
  * **Day 10**: Implemented **chat history** and session management, giving the agent a "memory" to hold context-aware conversations.
  * **Day 11**: Made the application more robust by adding **server-side and client-side error handling**, including a friendly fallback audio message for API failures.
  * **Day 12**: Performed a major **UI revamp**, simplifying the interface to a single, animated record button and a cleaner, more modern aesthetic.
  * **Day 13**: Focused on **documentation**, creating a comprehensive `README.md` file to explain the project's architecture, features, and setup.
  * **Day 14**: **Refactored the project structure** by organizing the code into `services`, `schemas`, and `config` files for better modularity.
  * **Day 15**: **Gave the agent a persona** to make the interaction more engaging and consistent.
  * **Day 16**: Implemented **streaming for AssemblyAI's STT service** for real-time transcription.
  * **Day 17**: Integrated **streaming for the Google Gemini LLM** to get faster responses.
  * **Day 18**: Added **streaming for Murf AI's TTS service** to start hearing the agent's voice sooner.
  * **Day 19**: Switched to **WebSockets** for persistent, real-time, and bidirectional communication.
  * **Day 20**: Implemented **turn detection** in the STT service to know when the user has finished speaking.
  * **Day 21**: Integrated **SerpAPI** for real-time Google Search results.
  * **Day 22**: Implemented **function calling** with Google Gemini to let the agent decide when to use the search tool.
  * **Day 23**: Refined the UI to show **real-time transcription and the agent's thoughts**.
  * **Day 24**: Added a **loading animation and other visual cues** to the UI.
  * **Day 25**: Added a **welcome message** that plays on page load.
  * **Day 26**: Gave the voice agent a name: **"Marvis"**.
  * **Day 27**: Revamped the UI and implemented a **settings panel** for API key configuration directly in the browser.
  * **Day 28**: Successfully **deployed the agent** to a public cloud server, making it accessible to all.
  * **Day 29**: Updated the main `README.md` to include all the latest features, architectural changes, and a complete project journey, ensuring the documentation is comprehensive and up-to-date with the current state of the voice agent.
  * **Day 30**: **Finalized the project**, wrapped up the 30-day challenge, and ensured all documentation provides a comprehensive overview of the entire journey.
